]. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the seeds in individual containers in a lightly shaded position. Germination rates, even of scarified seeds, can be quite low, with the seeds sprouting within 80 - 120 days[625TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 3.
