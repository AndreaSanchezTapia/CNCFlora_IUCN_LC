].PropagationSeed - it has a hard seedcoat and benefits from scarification before sowing to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the treated seed n a sunny position in a nursery seedbed. A high germination rate can be expected from treated seeds, with the seed sprouting within 28 - 42 days[420TitleBrazilian Trees.
