We have no more information for the wood from this species, but a general description of the wood from this genus is as follows:-
The heartwood is rather dark brown, usually poorly developed; the sapwood usually becoming red, pink, or violet-rose throughout or more often variegated and often fading to yellowish-brown on the surface. The texture is rather fine and uniform; the grain straight to irregular; lustre is medium to low; the wood is odourless when dry, the taste slightly bitter.  Based on a laboratory evaluation, the wood is reported to have moderate resistance to attack by decay fungi. Working properties are reported as good. The wood is used for purposes such as turnery, boxes and crates, interior trim, millwork, light construction[316TitleTropical Timbers of the World. Ag. Handbook No. 607.
