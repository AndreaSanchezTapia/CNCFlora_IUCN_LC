Symplocos lanceolata
A.DC.
Symplocaceae
This name is not accepted in the online 2012 'Flora do Brasil', which treats it as a synonym of Symplocarpus oblongifolia Casar. The treatment in the Flora do Brasil is based on Aranha Filho, J.L.M. 2011. Symplocaceae. Pp. 195-209 in T.B. Cavalcanti & A.P. Silva (orgs.), Flora do Distrito Federal, vol. 9. Embrapa Recursos GenÃ©ticos e Biotecnologia, BrasÃ­lia, Brasil. If this treatment becomes more widely accepted then Symplocos lanceolata will need to be transferred to Symplocos oblongifolia. In the short term we have included Symplocos oblongifolia in the list of synonyms of Symplocos lanceolata[KTitlePlants for a Future
