Cultivation Details
This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755TitleNodulation Plants in GRIN Taxonomy

DescriptionAn online database listing plants that have either positive or negative reports on root and stem nodulation with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
].Edible UsesNone knownMedicinalNone knownOther UsesWe have no information on the wood of this species. However, a general description of the wood from plants in this genus is as follows:-
The heartwood is dark brown, reddish-brown, or nearly black, in solid colour or somewhat variegated; it is sharply demarcated from the nearly white to yellowish sapwood. The texture is very fine to medium; the grain straight to irregular; lustre is usually medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The heartwood is very resistant to attack by decay fungi and resistant to dry-wood termites, though it is not resistant to marine borers. The wood is generally reported to be moderately difficult to air dry because of checking and warp. It is difficult to work because of its high density, but it finishes very smoothly and takes a high polish. It is used for purposes such as inlay, parquet flooring, turnery, furniture, cabinetwork, violin bows, specialty items; and has been suggested as a substitute for ebony[316TitleTropical Timbers of the World.
