General InformationCoussapoa microcarpa is an evergreen tree with a longish, sparse crown; it can grow 8 - 15 metres tall. The straight bole can be 50 - 70cm in diameter. The plant can sometimes be a semi-parasite growing on other trees - in such circumstances it can produce 'strangling roots' which constrict the other tree and lead to its eventual death[420TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 2. 4th Edition.
