The wood is scented of coumarin. It is medium-textured, straight-grained, very heavy, hard, tough, very strong with excellent mechanical properties and durable. It is moderately difficult to season because of its tendency to warp and check during drying. The wood is rather hard to carve and work with tools, but finishes smoothly with sharp cutting edges; it turns well; polishes nicely; and has good weathering properties. It is used for scantlings and beams in construction; for fine furniture; door and window frames; boards, floor blocks, lathe work, truck bodies etc[341TitleSouth American Timbers: the Properties, Uses and Characteristics of 190 Species.

Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[KTitlePlants for a Future
