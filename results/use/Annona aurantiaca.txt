Cultivation DetailsA plant of the 'Pantanal' region of S. America, which has an average yearly rainfall of 1,000 - 1,400mm, but is fed by the upper Paraguay River which floods in the wet season, causing large areas to be under water for several months of the year. Its average temperature is 25Â°c, but this can fluctuate from 0 - 40Â°c.Edible UsesFruit[46TitleDictionary of Economic Plants.

].MedicinalNone knownOther UsesNone knownPropagationThe seed of many species in this genus has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[KTitlePlants for a Future
