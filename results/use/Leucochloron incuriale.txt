This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200TitleThe New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. 1992.

].PropagationSeed - it has a hard seedcoat and, unless sown as soon as it is ripe and still moist, may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Seedlings resent root disturbance, so sow the seeds in individual containers in a semi-shaded position. A high germination rate in excess of 80% can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within 7 - 15 days[419TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 1. 4th Edition.
