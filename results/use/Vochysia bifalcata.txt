We do not have any more information on the wood for this species. However, a general description of the wood for trees in this genus is as follows:-
The heartwood is a dull uniform pink, pinkish- brown or golden-brown; it is not always sharply demarcated from the whitish to yellowish sapwood. The texture is moderately coarse; the grain slightly to highly interlocked; lustre is medium to high; there is no distinctive odour or taste. Vertical traumatic gum ducts may occur sporadically, and is sometimes considered as an objectionable defect. Different species are variable in decay resistance, they are generally reported to be susceptible to attack by fungi as well as insects. Air drying rates range from slow to rapid, the wood being prone to warp with some checking; collapse occurs in thick stock; quartersawing is suggested to minimize degrade. The wood is easily worked by either hand or machine tools, but raised and wooly grain are common defects; it takes glue, paint, and nails well, and polishes to a good finish; it has a tendency to blunt cutting edges. It is used for purposes such as carpentry, utility plywood, furniture components, interior trim, millwork. It has been suggested as a substitute for Cedrela[316TitleTropical Timbers of the World. Ag. Handbook No. 607.
