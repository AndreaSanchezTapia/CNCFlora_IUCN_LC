Annonaceae
This name is not universally accepted. We are following the treatment in the online Flora do Brasil 2012, but some other treatments accept the genus Rollinia, in which case the correct name for this species would be Rollinia sericea (R.E.Fr.) R.E.Fr.[KTitlePlants for a Future

].PropagationSeed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the seed as sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A low germination rate can be expected from untreated seed, with the seed sprouting within 30 - 50 days[420TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 2. 4th Edition.
