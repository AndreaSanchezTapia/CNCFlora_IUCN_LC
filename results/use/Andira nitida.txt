].PropagationSeed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the large seeds in a partially shaded position in individual containers. A germination rate of less than 50% can be expected for untreated seed, even when sown fresh, with the seed sprouting within 80 - 120 days[625TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 3.
