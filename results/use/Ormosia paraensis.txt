Cultivation Details
This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755TitleNodulation Plants in GRIN Taxonomy

The heartwood is yellow-brown to red-brown, with thin light brown streaks; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 15cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is coarse, grain interlocked. The wood is fairly hard to hard, moderately heavy, with good elasticity, moderately durable, and resistant to damage from fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It is slow to dry with a slight risk of checking and distortion, and is moderately stable to poorly stable in service. The wood generally is easy to work, though there are sometimes diffiulties due to the interlocked grain, surfaces are slightly fuzzy and finishing requires care. Peeling and slicing are good, it takes nails and screws well and glues correctly. It is used for furniture, flooring, joinery, heavy carpentry, panelling, veneer and turnery[848TitleTropix 7

].PropagationLike many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[KTitlePlants for a Future
