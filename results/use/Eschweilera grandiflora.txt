We do not have any more specific information for this species, but the general description for the wood of this genus is as follows:-
The heartwood of most species is light brown, grayish-brown, reddish-brown, or brownish-buff, sometimes with black streaks; it is usually distinct from the yellowish sapwood. The texture is fine and uniform; the grain typically straight; lustre is low; there is no distinctive odour or taste. Depending on the species, silica content may be as high as 2.4%. Most species are highly resistant to attack by both brown-rot and white-rot fungi. Also most of the species have gained wide recognition for their high degree of resistance to marine-borer attack. Resistance to dry-wood termite attack is variable, depending on species. The wood is rated as fairly difficult to air season, drying rates are slow to moderate. Warp and checking are rated as slight to moderate, depending on species. Most of the species are difficult to work because of the high density and high silica content (excepting E. Tenax); specially tipped cutters are suggested. They can be used for purposes such as marine and other heavy construction, industrial flooring, pulpmill
equipment, railroad crossties, piling, and turnery[316TitleTropical Timbers of the World. Ag. Handbook No. 607.
