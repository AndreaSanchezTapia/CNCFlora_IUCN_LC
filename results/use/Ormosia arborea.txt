This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[].Edible UsesNone knownMedicinalNone knownAgroforestry Uses:A moderately fast-growing tree, able to thrive in drier soils and fixing atmospheric nitrogen, it can be used as a pioneer species when restoring native woodland[419TitleBrazilian Trees.

We do not have any more information on the wood of this species, but a general description for the wood of S. American members of this genus is as follows:-
The heartwood is pinkish to reddish, mostly salmon-coloured, sometimes yellowish-brown, more or less streaked; it is not always distinct from the yellowish sapwood. The texture is coarse to very coarse; the grain mostly irregular; lustre usually medium; it feels harsh; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is generally reported to be quite susceptible to attack by decay fungi; it is vulnerable to dry-wood termites, and prone to powder-post beetle attack
(sapwood). It generally air dries very slowly; checking and warp vary from slight to moderate. For most species, the wood is reported to saw and machine easily, with fair to good results; surfaces, however, are somewhat rough and difficult to finish. It is used for furniture components, interior construction, general carpentry, and utility veneer[316TitleTropical Timbers of the World. Ag. Handbook No. 607.

].PropagationSeed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the seed in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. A germination rate in excess of 50% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 20 - 50 days[419TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 1. 4th Edition.
