The seed is very small and should only be covered with a very thin layer of soil - cover the soil with a cheese cloth to avoid washing the seeds away when watering, removing the cloth as soon as germination is evident. A low germination rate can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within a few weeks[419TitleBrazilian Trees. Volume 1. 4th Edition.
