]. The seed may benefit from scarification before sowing, in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing.Cite as: Tropical Plants Database, Ken Fern. tropical.theferns.info. 2018-12-24. <tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Endopleura+uchi>
