```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Objective

To check the UICN status of 763 species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. 
 

# Methods
## Taxonomic status check 
11-dec-2018 

## Occurrence download
From GBIF using rgbif function. 

Two separate search rounds: 

+ one with all the records that come from exsicatta, with or wihtout coordinates and with or without geospatial issues
+ one of all records with coordinates and no geospatial issues

A cleaning process:

+ Deleting duplicata colector-year-collection number
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
